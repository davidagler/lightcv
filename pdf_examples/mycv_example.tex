\begin{dated}[Student Evaluations (Qualitative)]
    PHIL010 & The handouts were much more efficient than other styles of teaching I have experienced. You could follow along without any confusion of where we were, and you never were behind in taking notes. Also, the demonstrations and visual representation of the topics on the chalk board made it much easier to follow along instead of just listening to lecture. It was also very helpful that we covered each topic in the same manner. The order of definition, to clarification, to examples, to creating your own examples consistently helped me learn. - SU2015\\
    PHIL013 & The instructor’s enthusiasm and high energy, as well as the interesting
    material covered in the class made me look forward to coming to class. He did an excellent job explaining diffcult concepts through humorous examples. The instructor also did a great job challenging the students and encouraging them to think critically
    by posing very interesting questions. I also appreciated how eager the instructor was in
    hearing our feedback for the course and his willingness to implement the suggestions. - FA2014\\
    PHIL013 & The teacher used many different ways to get his point across, which helped understand a lot of lessons. He used videos, drawings on the blackboard, lecture, and group thinking to get ideas across. Talking among a group made me learn the most because it helped to hear other people’s interpretation of what was just being lectured. - FA2014\\
    PHIL012 & Of all online courses I have taken at Penn State, professor Agler has been the most successful at teaching the course and providing ample resources to students, despite the difficult online platform. While the material is difficult to understand, Agler’s
    textbook breaks down the information in a very helpful way. His online discussion board is an invaluable resource to students that find themselves having questions on the material. Even more so, Agler’s response time (usually within a few hours) proves his dedication and true care for his students’ success. While sometimes difficult to explain, he takes the time to write back to every student’s question. He keeps his students alert of upcoming assignments (something that is easy to forget with an online course) by
    sending out regular emails. - SP2015\\
    PHIL012 & Normally with online courses, I am nervous about the amount of contact I will be able to have with the professor. Professor Agler extends himself to all students and makes sure they are able to contact him and get further help on the course material. He provides continuous updates and is proactive with his students. - SP2015\\
    PHIL012 & Dr. Agler was the most important aspect. I'm not really a math person and was a little bit apprehensive of a class that has many math elements to it, but Dr. Agler sets you up for success by giving you the tools you need to succeed: breakdowns of complex problems in class, detailed videos that he's made online, the textbook and packet which explain just about everything necessary, etc. Dr. Agler has set up the course in a way that if you want to succeed and you put the work in, you almost certainly will. You can tell he's very passionate about the subject by his willingness to help and go above and beyond for his students. He's also a genuinely good and funny guy, which helps him connect with the class and makes class entertaining - FA2021\\
    PHIL012 & Agler was very realistic throughout the course regarding pace and contenthe was comfortable altering the schedule and material to accommodate the needs of the class. This allowed for extensive review and increased comprehension, especially with
    the more difficult content in the course. He has a great sense of humor and connected with the students on a level that most college professors are unable to achieve. As a student who ordinarily struggles with math-related classes, he provided an environment
    that allowed me to excel past my expectations. The youtube videos were also extremely helpful when we were initially learning about truth trees. Overall, interesting (but challenging) class and awesome professor. - FA2015\\
    PHIL012 & The professor was very willing to help out students and re-word the explanations to better understand the concept. He would ALWAYS give real life examples to each new concept to help people understand at an easier level. He also found a tutor for students as well because this is known to be a relatively difficult course. He was an overall kind and understanding guy. - FA2015\\
    PHIL012 & As we near the end of the course, I wanted to thank you for all of your
    generosity throughout the semester. In my [...] years at Penn State and [...] years of
    school prior, I have never had an educator more willing to help students learn. Online
    classes tend to be more challenging, and having you as a professor made this course
    significantly less stressful. I was challenged throughout the entire course, but was
    helped in a way that I actually learned concepts I will take with me. As I study for
    the LSAT, many techniques of logic learned in this course are extraordinarily helpful.
    You consistently helped me do my best throughout the course and you never made me
    feel stupid or like I was bothering you, even though I emailed you multiple times each
    week. Thank you for being such an outstanding professor, and your eagerness to help
    students is refreshing. I truly appreciate all of the additional help and encouragement
    you provided throughout the semester. - SP2017\\
    PHIL297 & I’m going to use this space to express how much I liked David because there
    isn’t one. David was awesome. I really enjoyed his lectures, the way he explained
    things, and his passion for the subjects. Great work! - FA2016
